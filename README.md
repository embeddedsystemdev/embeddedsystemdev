- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @embeddedsystemdev but friends call me Mietek :)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in embedded systems xd
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C, C++, PCB design , Linux and ... everything needed to be better software engineer.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me embeddedsystemdev@gmail.com

Repositories on this github account are my playground, here I am learning, training and testing stuff. Beside of that I have my regular job in corporate world. Professionaly I was mainly focused on telecomm projects which base was on Linux OS on MIPS platform. Also I am familiar with microprocessors from ARM family, especially STM32 MCU.

I've started to gain experience in 2020AD, and from that time I was doing:

- Linux :
    Interprocess communication,
    Userspace programming,
    POSIX, A litte bit of network configuration, 

- STM32 :
    HAL (Hardware Abstact Layer),
    CubeMX,
    PCB Design
    Used many sensors like: GPS shields, BME280 (temp and pressure), Keyboards, Encoders and so on...
